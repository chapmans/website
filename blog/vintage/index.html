<p>Here&#8217;s a picture of my turntable, a Technics SL-1200. It was manufactured between 1979 and 2010 and has been most commonly used for DJing. I have no idea how old mine actually is &#8211; I bought mine from eBay.</p>

<p>So, I bought this piece of old technology which looks really cool, but there&#8217;s really no point to it (I don&#8217;t plan on DJing with a turntable anytime soon). With record players, I gain unnoticeably higher sound quality, but I&#8217;m losing portability and convenience. I&#8217;m purposely deciding that I want my music to be stored in these large, black 12-inch records rather than the smaller, shinier CDs or the seemingly invisible space of a hard drive. So really, why? Why would I get a turntable?</p>

<p>Because it&#8217;s cool. There&#8217;s not too much to it. But <em>why</em> exactly would I find a turntable cool in this day and age?</p>

<p>Digital media is becoming the norm; I know more people that use Spotify and Netflix instead of going out and buying a CD or DVD (or, god forbid, renting from Blockbuster if those still exist). With this increasing digitalization, the way we interact with music, movies, and video games are becoming strictly two-dimensional. Owning a movie doesn&#8217;t mean having a plastic case with a circular disc inside it. Instead, we just click a &#8220;Purchased&#8221; button to see that we do in fact own that movie. It&#8217;s not exciting, and it doesn&#8217;t feel like there&#8217;s value to it.</p>

<p>For music, vinyl still exists, however, and there&#8217;s a physicality to it. Instead of getting 500x500px cover art, we get a 12x12in. piece of artwork. Instead of seeing the waveforms, you can feel the ridges<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup> that represent the music. And instead of the music being abstracted through a progress bar and some metadata about the mp3, you can actually <em>see</em> the needle moving along the ridges, progressing through the center. A turntable makes the process of playing music seem less abstract.</p>

<p>My Technics SL-1200 is also a remarkably well-designed turntable. Design feels more noticeable today because of computers. Many UX/UI designers are hired to essentially make the placement of pixels on a screen as pleasant as possible. There are sites <a href='http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/'>focused on critiquing logos</a> and people have the power to <a href='http://www.aiga.org/the-uc-logo-controversy/'>&#8220;undo&#8221; a logo</a>. More people know and recognize Helvetica<sup id='fnref:2'><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup> now than twenty years ago. And Apple can be very profitable by selling a very nicely designed product. I would think that the industrial design of the Technics SL-1200 is more appreciated today just because companies like Apple have made people care more about things like this.</p>

<p>And then there&#8217;s the fact that it&#8217;s &#8220;vintage&#8221;, whatever that means. There&#8217;s a meaning that can be gained from seeing a turntable at someone&#8217;s place, similar to the way that pianos seem to exist but not be played in a typical middle-class household. All this digital stuff means that it&#8217;s easier to create our individual online personas, but it also means that offline expression becomes less material. This might be good, this might not be.</p>

<p>Or maybe, you know, turntables are cool just because they <em>are</em>.</p>

<p>Of course, this is something you just don&#8217;t do. <a href='#fnref:1' rev='footnote'>&#8617;</a></p>

<p>Then again, today&#8217;s Helvetica is <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotham_(typeface)'>Gotham</a>, and not enough people realize how it&#8217;s literally everywhere nowadays. <a href='#fnref:2' rev='footnote'>&#8617;</a></p>
