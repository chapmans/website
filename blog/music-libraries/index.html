<h2 class="title">Music Libraries<div class="date">28 May 2013</div></h2>

<p>With iTunes, Spotify, YouTube, etc., it&#8217;s easier than ever to find that one artist, one album, one song that only you connect with. You don&#8217;t have to sift into shelves of vinyl or go through a ton of CD racks at some random record store; you just need to type something into a search bar. The fact that it&#8217;s becoming so <em>easy</em> to be &#8220;unique&#8221; though means that our music tastes are just another bit making up our digital fingerprints.</p>

<p>The idea of digital fingerprints comes from how there&#8217;s enough publicly accessible data on someone&#8217;s computer that can be accessed to result in a unique configuration. EFF&#8217;s <a href='https://panopticlick.eff.org/'>Panopticlick</a> tests this. For example, the combination of fonts on someone&#8217;s computer, which can be grabbed through Flash, might be enough to identify them. The fact that it&#8217;s so easy to pinpoint a particular computer configuration means that it&#8217;s easy to track and specifically advertise to a particular computer &#8211; and a particular person.</p>

<p>The thing with music libraries is that there are so many places to share them. I really, really like <a href='http://www.amazon.com/music/dp/B001CR49OI'>Shugo Tokumaru&#8217;s <em>Exit</em></a><sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup>; I&#8217;m one of the 27,000 people who scrobbled the album on <a href='http://www.last.fm/music/Shugo+Tokumaru/Exit'>last.fm</a>, one of the (almost) 12,000 people who liked the <a href='https://www.facebook.com/shugotokumaru'>Facebook page</a>, one of many who posted a song from the album on <a href='http://chapzork.tumblr.com/tagged/shugo%20tokumaru'>Tumblr</a>, and one of 52 people giving the album over four stars on <a href='http://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/shugo_tokumaru/exit/'>Rate Your Music</a>. It&#8217;s pretty easy to figure out who I am on all these different sites, especially with more additional information like how I also really like <a href='http://www.amontobin.com/'>Amon Tobin</a>, <a href='http://www.kronekodow.com/'>Shiina Ringo</a>, and <a href='http://warp.net/records/broadcast'>Broadcast</a>.</p>

<p>This stuff &#8211; deanonymizing people based on values in a database &#8211; has been <a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0610105'>done</a> <a href='http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE3DD1F3FF93AA3575BC0A9609C8B63'>before</a>. So much <em>personal</em> <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data'>data</a> through our searches and likes are out there constantly being processed and analyzed, and it&#8217;s creepy what <a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/magazine/shopping-habits.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=2&amp;hp&amp;'>conclusions</a> have been made from this data.</p>

<p>Music is deeply personal. It&#8217;s possible to figure out someone&#8217;s political and religious opinions from seeing what they listen to, and it probably wouldn&#8217;t be too hard to figure out someone&#8217;s general location based on when they started to listen to a particular artist<sup id='fnref:2'><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup>. I wonder: what other information can be inferred from, say, the fact that I listened to <em>Exit</em> at least 16 times during a <a href='http://www.last.fm/user/yesh/charts?charttype=weekly&amp;subtype=track&amp;range=1226836800-1227441600'>week of November 2008</a>? How identifiable can someone be with just a tiny piece of data?</p>
<div class='footnotes'><hr /><ol><li id='fn:1'>
<p>This is completely random, but he was on the same <a href='http://www.almostgoldrecordings.com/artists/'>North American label</a> as Peter Bjorn &amp; John and Calvin Harris were a few years ago. Hm. <a href='#fnref:1' rev='footnote'>&#8617;</a></p>
</li><li id='fn:2'>
<p>In some ways, this isn&#8217;t as true now, but I was just thinking of how music comes from these local scenes. <a href='#fnref:2' rev='footnote'>&#8617;</a></p>
