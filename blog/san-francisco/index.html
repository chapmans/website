<h2 class="title">San Francisco<div class="date">01 Jun 2013</div></h2>

<p>There are about six square miles in San Francisco that seem to have a particularly high density of tech startups. Most startups seem to be concentrated in SoMa, though many of them also seem to be located in the Mission district and Potrero Hill. Many of these companies have one-word, two-syllable cutesy names and simple logos, and they do something related to mobile and/or advertising. This is the &#8220;hip&#8221; section of the tech world in many ways.</p>

<p>The online version of this is <a href='http://news.ycombinator.com/'>Hacker News</a>. It&#8217;s a fantastic site &#8211; it&#8217;s basically Reddit for this tech startup community. Instead of memes and gifs hosted on imgur, most of the links are of blog posts on <a href='https://medium.com/'>Medium</a> or code on GitHub. From browsing this site, I learned that there was more to computer science than the university-taught C/Java/PHP, along with this thing called venture capital. In the same way though, the community has a fairly narrow viewpoint that makes it feel isolated from the rest of the world. Just scroll through the site &#8211; when the links aren&#8217;t overly techy blog posts (usually about some type of Javascript framework), they&#8217;re links to The New Yorker or The Atlantic or they&#8217;re just about the design of anything. It&#8217;s a place where everyone seem to be somewhat affluent with time on their hands. Even the posts about someone <a href='http://news.cnet.com/8301-32973_3-57440513-296/meet-the-tireless-entrepreneur-who-squatted-at-aol/'>living in the AOL headquarters for a year</a> or living in a car as sacrificing for their startup doesn&#8217;t sound like desperation at all.</p>

<p>This point of view skews things. It means that the problems that developers try to solve and &#8220;change the world&#8221; with tend to be superficial. Many articles last month discussed this &#8211; the Washington Post had a <a href='http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/05/27/is-silicon-valley-only-interested-in-the-problems-of-twentysomethings/'>blog post</a> responding to a <a href='http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/05/27/130527fa_fact_packer'>New Yorker article</a> by George Packer on Silicon Valley politics. Both of these articles are about the fact that startups aren&#8217;t &#8220;changing the world&#8221;. Instead, they&#8217;re either catering to twenty-somethings or businesses. Basically, to the people with superficial needs and money. And so, this tech startup community, physical and virtual, are by default going to be in this floating bubble of money and convenience problems.</p>

<p>In <a href='http://programmingisterrible.com/post/50421878989/come-here-and-work-on-hard-problems-except-the-ones'>this</a> blog post, the author discusses the self-containment of this startup world. He sees these glorified startup workplaces in contrast to the bum-filled streets right in that area in San Francisco. Similarly, <a href='http://miter.mit.edu/the-unexotic-underclass/'>this</a> post that&#8217;s been getting talked about recently discusses the &#8220;unexotic underclass&#8221; &#8211; the kind of poverty-striken people in America that are kind of just not &#8220;interesting&#8221; or &#8220;exotic&#8221; in ways that children in India or South Sudan are.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not easy if you&#8217;re living in these few square miles of San Francisco to want to care about these issues and to realize that the outside world is completely different.</p>
<!-- Then I came back home to San Francisco. What happened? I'm not sure if it's my proselytizing into this tech world or I've only realized this because I've mostly been in San Diego, but the mood of the city felt different. In the business district, it's not strange to see signs for one-word two-syllable simple logo companies probably making some kind of mobile product. And it's not just SoMa where there's this distinct feeling. I saw bus ads for [Exec][exec], an errand service, in the Excelsior, one of the more lower-class neighborhoods here in San Francisco. It's an area where very few people would want to hire a maid or get someone to grab groceries for them through some kind of nice web interface. -->
