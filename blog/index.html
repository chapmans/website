      <p>Here&#8217;s a picture of my turntable, a Technics SL-1200. It was manufactured between 1979 and 2010 and has been most commonly used for DJing. I have no idea how old mine actually is &#8211; I bought mine from eBay.</p>

      <p>Blogging is kind of annoying. I&#8217;ve tried using many blogging platforms, including Wordpress, Blogger, Tumblr, and Movable Type, but none of these really ever worked. There&#8217;s one goal of blogging: to post substantive posts in consistent periods of time. I&#8217;ve never really been able to do this, and part of the reason is that it just isn&#8217;t fun to write posts on these platform.</p>

      <p>There are about six square miles in San Francisco that seem to have a particularly high density of tech startups. Most startups seem to be concentrated in SoMa, though many of them also seem to be located in the Mission district and Potrero Hill. Many of these companies have one-word, two-syllable cutesy names and simple logos, and they do something related to mobile and/or advertising. This is the &#8220;hip&#8221; section of the tech world in many ways.</p>

      <p>With iTunes, Spotify, YouTube, etc., it&#8217;s easier than ever to find that one artist, one album, one song that only you connect with. You don&#8217;t have to sift into shelves of vinyl or go through a ton of CD racks at some random record store; you just need to type something into a search bar. The fact that it&#8217;s becoming so <em>easy</em> to be &#8220;unique&#8221; though means that our music tastes are just another bit making up our digital fingerprints.</p>

      <p>This past week&#8217;s tech news has mostly been about <a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/20/technology/yahoo-to-buy-tumblr-for-1-1-billion.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0'>Yahoo buying Tumblr</a> for $1 billion.

      <p>Hey everyone! Here&#8217;s my fairly simple blog/website. I wanted to make something that wasn&#8217;t flashy (because that&#8217;s basically how web design in 2013 seems to work and because I&#8217;m just bad at making complex designs) because my goal was to make something readable and navigable.</p>
