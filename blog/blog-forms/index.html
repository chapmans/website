<p>Blogging is kind of annoying. I&#8217;ve tried using many blogging platforms, including Wordpress, Blogger, Tumblr, and Movable Type, but none of these really ever worked. There&#8217;s one goal of blogging: to post substantive posts in consistent periods of time. I&#8217;ve never really been able to do this, and part of the reason is that it just isn&#8217;t fun to write posts on these platform.</p>

<p>Look at Wordpress, for example. The good thing about Wordpress is that it has every option that someone would ever need in customizing a blog. The bad thing is that it has <em>everything</em>. It&#8217;s nice that it&#8217;s easy to add some pictures, edit the permalink, or change the published date, but I&#8217;m never going to need to add a poll or a contact form or connect the post to my nonexistent LinkedIn or turn off likes for just one post or do some other random specific-use things<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup>. I just want to write.</p>

<p><img alt='Wordpress/Tumblr' src='/images/blog1.jpg' /></p>

<p>I also want my blog posts to be at least half the size of an article and with a more personal bent. This is where Tumblr doesn&#8217;t work for me. There are many people who use Tumblr as a blogging platform &#8211; here&#8217;s a <a href='http://tomewing.tumblr.com/'>few</a> <a href='http://agrammar.tumblr.com/'>music</a> <a href='http://www.markrichardson.org/'>critics</a> (kind of) doing so &#8211; but that&#8217;s not what it&#8217;s intended for. Tumblr is <em>fantastic</em> for posting/reposting gifs and for reactionary comments, but as a short-form writing platform, it&#8217;s terrible.</p>

<p>Fortunately, some people have realized what&#8217;s wrong with blogging. Dustin Curtis created his <a href='http://dcurt.is/codename-svbtle'>Svbtle</a> platform/magazine a year ago, and more recently <a href='https://medium.com/about/9e53ca408c48'>Medium</a> popped out of nowhere. These two sites have <em>beautiful</em> post editors. The ten minutes that I interacted with the Medium platform was pretty amazing due to how clean everything was and how everything just worked. My only problems with these two sites are that they&#8217;re exclusive and all blogs look the same. I just want that clean easy-blogging interface, but it has to be tightly connected with this rigid (albeit very nicely designed) frontend output.</p>

<p><img alt='Medium' src='/images/medium.jpg' /></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to work on making some kind of nice blogging interface during my free time. Here&#8217;s the <a href='https://github.com/chapzork/blogform'>project</a> on GitHub; it&#8217;s currently not completely working right now as I&#8217;ve been using the project as a Javascript framework learning tool more than anything. The interface is really simple; all there is to each post is a title, the post body, and adding tags. The post body uses Markdown to parse the content (like everything seems to do nowadays). It&#8217;s not completely thought out yet, and I might just end up changing everything about it tomorrow, so&#8230;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I&#8217;m just using Jekyll for this website. I&#8217;m writing my posts in a text editor with Markdown, and honestly, that&#8217;s enough. I might just stick with this.</p>

<p>Two more things about Wordpress:</p>

<ol>
<li>It has a distraction-free writing mode that I just noticed. It&#8217;s a bit better, but&#8230;nah.</li>

<li>Wordpress is written in PHP, so it&#8217;s not very fun if there&#8217;s something specific I want to change that&#8217;s not in their hundreds of options.</li>
