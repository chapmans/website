<p><img src="/images/me3.jpg"></p>

<p>My name is Chapman Seto. I am originally from San Francisco, though I am currently a third year Computer Science major at UC San Diego. My primary interest (and hopeful career) is in computers and programming. At this moment, I am particularly invested in learning about web development and security, but I'm open to learning whatever comes my way. To see what I've worked on, take a look at my <a href="/resume">resume</a> and <a href="https://github.com/chapzork">GitHub</a> account.

<p>I'm interested in the unforseen ways that technology can impact people's lives, specifically the idea that this technology has made it easier for people to connect with one another whenever and wherever they are. Computers can be boiled down as containers of data, but it's fascinating to see what can be done with them. My <a href="/blog">blog</a> explores the ways that technology fuses with culture and human beings.</p>

<p>Closely related to this is my interest in design. It's often the little things that can have surprising amounts of impact, and design is one of these. As a developer, ideas from design help me with understanding the context of my code.</p>

<p>Other things about me: Hiking is okay. I dislike watching Youtube videos because each video tells me how much time I'm going to waste watching it. I wouldn't mind becoming a music critic (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lemon_of_Pink">this</a> is a pretty great album). I'm an avid lurker on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>. I'm fascinated with architecture.</p>

<p>You can also find me on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/chapmanseto">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/chapzork">Twitter</a>, and <a href="http://instagram.com/chapzork">Instagram</a>.</p>
